                        the perimeter of Minnesota, starting 3 July, in honor of my friend
                        Vic Rosenthal. Vic led <a href="https://www.jewishcommunityaction.org/" target="_blank">Jewish Community Action</a> for 17 years,
                        spearheading initiatives such as the Minnesota marriage
                        amendment, fair housing in Minneapolis, and fighting for workers’
                        rights in Iowa. His death this spring leaves a legacy of community
                        organizing rooted in deep, enduring relationships.

                        It was my joy to call Vic both mentor and friend. I plan to ride
                        through every county in Minnesota that touches the state’s
                        border; that’s 1,500 miles! The money I raise in Vic’s honor goes
                        to <b>JCA</b> and to <b>Pillars Beyond Hospice</b> where Vic spent the last
                        few weeks of his life. To donate to either organization go to:
